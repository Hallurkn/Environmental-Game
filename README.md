# recycle-mania

Recycle Mania is a javascript game creates using Create.js.

The game was developed during the course Javascript Games on the 3rd semester of myt Multimediadesign & Communication programme at KEA.

The goal of this game was to develop a game centered around creating awareness of global warming, and somehow battle it with the game.

Recycle Mania takes place on an open road, where you are a young boy who recycles trash sent from the sky by an unknown alien lifeform.
